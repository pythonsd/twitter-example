Twitter API Project
===========================

This is a tutorial aimed at users new to Python but looking to
dive into a real world project by querying the Twitter API_.
The project idea and some other ideas were liberally borrowed
from the `Boston Python Group`_.

.. _API: https://dev.twitter.com
.. _Boston Python Group: https://openhatch.org/wiki/Boston_Python_Workshop_5/Twitter_handout

In this project, you will adapt an existing script which queries
the Twitter API to print out the users and tweet text for a 
`Twitter search`_.
